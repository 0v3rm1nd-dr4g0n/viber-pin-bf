# viber-pin-bf.rb - Viber PIN bruteforce
#
# This little pice of software will bruteforce the Viber "PIN" key. Viber is a Skype-like 
# software that claims to have 100 million worldwide users.
#
# Instead of having Viber usernames you use your own mobile phone number as username. 
# When signing up for Viber you confirm that you own the mobile phone number by entering
# a four digit PIN code that you get by SMS in the registation process.
# 
# Four digit, no bruteforce protection, API-axss - A winning concept. \o/ Or well, they 
# have "some kind" of brute force "protection". After something like ten tries they 
# increment the PIN-code by 1. :)
# 
# I've tried to inform them about this. But they ignore my tweets and mails. They ignoring
# me results in me ignoring them.
#
# STICK TO THE INSTRUCTIONS OR IT WONT WORK. --help
